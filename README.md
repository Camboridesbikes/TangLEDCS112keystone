# TangLED Lanterns

### 	Keystone Project for CS 112 (as well as a personal project)

​		The idea of this project is to have a dynamic amount of led lanterns connect to each other using a mesh network and communicate their state as well as commands to change their color and/or behavior. As a companion to this hardware, I will be able to connect to the mesh with a computer or mobile device and manipulate the lanterns individually or by group.

​	This project is a personal project that started as an idea 3 years ago and began working on this last year. I'm using the keystone project for class as an opportunity to expand on this brain-child of mine. 

​	This repo contains the code for the micro controllers as well as the java code for the desktop app I am writing for class.

## Lanterns

The lanterns are built off esp32 and esp8285/8266 microcontrollers. 

Libraries used: PainlessMesh, FastLED
